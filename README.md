We present GLARE, a novel network for low-light image enhancement.

- **Codebook-based LLIE**: exploit normal-light (NL) images to extract NL codebook prior as the guidance.
- **Generative Feature Learning**: develop an invertible latent normalizing flow strategy for feature alignment.
- **Adaptive Feature Transformation**: adaptively introduces input information into the decoding process and allows flexible adjustments for users. 
- **Future:** network structure can be meticulously optimized to improve efficiency and performance in the future.
